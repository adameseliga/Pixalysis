In order to run this script, you must have Python 3.8 installed, as well as
Flask, PIL, NumPy, Werkzueg, and the colorsys and os modules. When the
script is ran, it will open the webpage on your default browser under
a local port. This script is not fully developed and still contains bugs. Use at your
own risk.
I have included some test images in the folder named "examples." When sorted, the
result will be saved in the upload folder.
